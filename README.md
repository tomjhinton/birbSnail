# birbSnail

For @sableRaph's weekly Creative Coding Challenge. The Challenge topic was 'Snail'.

Kind of a rushed one, had an idea but only just about got it to a very basic level. Click the title to see the cannon debugger.

None of this is opitmised, this is not a good way to do it, it was basically a quick way to implement the idea. If you make more and smaller tiles, my laptop does helicopter noise impressions.  

# Blender Bit.
- Look I modelled it from memory and it kind of looks like a snail, what more do you want?
- Yes, I know grafting a spiral to the side of a flat shape is not the same as an actual snail shell.


# Three + Cannon Bit.
- Used the Cannon-es RigidVehicle and linked the snail model to the body.
- [Rigid Vehicle](https://pmndrs.github.io/cannon-es/examples/rigid_vehicle)
- Added a 5th wheel.
- Changed the material of the ground if the 5th wheel made contact.
- I'm aware the model is too low, its center is in the wrong place and fixing it was fiddly so I didnt.
- Stop Bodyshaming my snail, his center can be wherever it wants.

# Shader bit.
- Basic ripple, warp shader thing because that's what I always use.
- Used the co-ordiantes of the whole screen as opposed to the individual tile so it kind of works like revealing a picture.
